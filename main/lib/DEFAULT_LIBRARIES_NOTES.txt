	are limited to the libraries strictly needed for all the examples in the
	"examples" folder to properly compile.

					BE   AWARE   THAT

	These libraries, save for those written by me (Alessandro Ghignola) MAY NOT
	be up to date and the corresponding author will probably be providing more
	recent, and eventually improved, versions on his/her home site. Also, the
	author will probably be providing more libraries than the reduced set I may
	have included in "main/lib" for the examples to use.
