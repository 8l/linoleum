    DESCRIPTION
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you don't want to have to redefine all the symbols mentioned here,
    and you don't need customizing the iGUI's look, you might include this
    library IN PLACE of "iGUI"; this library itself includes iGUI for you and
    defines most of the symbols concerning the look of GUI elements, such as
    color schemes, gradients, effects and suchs.
      The "role" of all elements declared here is explained in detail in the
    source code of the Icon Editor. The Icon Editor does not use this library,
    and shows how to re-declare these elements for possible in-depth
    customization of the GUI's look and feel.
      This library may be part of a program-specific, and exportable, skin, if
    it's copied to the program's source code directory and changed to fit a
    new style: modifies here, however, might be limited to changing the actual
    values of the section marked as the "GUI SKIN BLOCK", and never ADDING,
    REMOVING, MISPLACING values from that section. For a skin to be correctly
    exported, there must be no changes in the memory layout of the skin block.
      While changing those values, you also have to avoid touching markers
    declared as "0 *** 0", which means a vector of size zero. The markers are
    used by the IGS library where import/export routines are built, to compute
    the size of each section of the skin block, and they are vital, as well as
    hexadecimal-encoded signatures.
      Apart from changing those values, other reasonable changes to values of
    the skin block might be done to better fit elements to a possible new set
    of graphics parts [buttons, tiled backgrounds, etc].
      The remaining symbols to define on the main program's side, are a few
    constants listed below; they are all assigned to INTEGER VALUES; *values
    marked with an asterisk will contribute to determine the size of several
    memory areas allocated by iGUI, and as a consequence, sensibly influence
    the amount of memory the final application needs:

	INITIAL WIDTH		 in pixels, how wide the window is at startup
	INITIAL HEIGHT		 in pixels, how tall the window is at startup
	MINIMUM WIDTH		 in pixels, width's lower limit
	MINIMUM HEIGHT		 in pixels, height's lower limit
	MAXIMUM WIDTH		*in pixels, widht's higher limit
	MAXIMUM HEIGHT		*in pixels, height's higher limit
	MAX MENU OPTIONS	*max. n. of options in a menu, incl. submenus
	MAX ONSCREEN OPTIONS	*max. n. of options visualized simultaneously
	MAX LEVELS IN SHOW	*reflects nesting level of last submenu: 1..4
	MAX FILES IN SELECTOR	*including file system links and directories
	MAX FILES IN SHOW	 will determine the height of a file selector
	MAX OPTIONS IN QUESTION *max. n. of pushbuttons/answers in a question
	MAX FIELDS IN QUESTION	*those declared with either F/... or S/...

      Additions needed to recompile an iGUI program past version 1.13.9b:

    --- BEFORE SIGNATURE 'EFEX':

 vector Balloon Border Colors  = 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f; 1.0f;
	Balloon Border	       = 1;

    --- BEFORE SIGNATURE 'SKIN':

	Question Border Effect = service FX Doublestrike Antialiasing Dim;
	Balloon Border Effect  = service FX Doublestrike Antialiasing Dim;

      Note: service FX Antialiasing... effects were added with version 1.13.9b
      of the PixelFX library, and although supported by the corresponding IGS
      library, elements treaten with those effects will not display when skins
      are imported in applications compiled with former versions.
