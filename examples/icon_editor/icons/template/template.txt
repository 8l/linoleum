	the style of L.in.oleum 1.13.9b. The template is supposed to be modified
	in its larger version with a painting program of your choice. Later, for
	better antialiasing you'll want to reduce it to the size of a L.in.oleum
	application icon, which is 48x48 pixels, and possibly doing that -after-
	smoothing the image so that it antialiases for good. Finally,  resulting
	picture will have to be converted to 256 colors, and here comes the time
	for a good converter. The file must be saved as a BMP like others in the
	"icons" folder, so that Icon Editor will load them up.
	The other icons were edited and converted with Adobe Photoshop 7.0, but:
	unfortunately, Photoshop saves some further parameters in its BMP files.
	My own way to workaround this problem was to load the picons in U-Lead's
	Finishingtouch,	which is a program old and simple (and beautiful) enough
	to ignore those parameters (I'm not sure what's their purpose but in the
	end they make the bitmap's header longer than Iconed expects, and that's
	the problem), and save back BMP files without them.  Well, alternatively
	you may take the effort of letting Iconed understand how long is the BMP
	header block and skip it properly. ATM, the BMP header is supposed to be
	40 bytes long, its effective size being given by the dword at offset +14
	of the bitmap file (small-endian 28000000h = 28h = 40 bytes),  so that's
	probably the value you'd be looking for to skip the header properly, and
	regardless of the header size...
