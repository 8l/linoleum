<br>SETTING UP L.in.oleum's ENVIRONMENT - IMPORTANT!!<br>
<blockquote>
In order to use the compiler in the most comfortable way, you need to
extract the contents of the "linoleum.zip" archive inside the folder
"C:\Linoleum". Then choose the 'install "compile as L.in.oleum source" option'
from the installation menu; alternatively, you may double-click the registry
icon ("install.reg" in the "docs" folder) and confirm when asked. This operation
will "activate" the compiler, making it ready for use throught a simple right-button
click on a text file's icon. You <u><i>might</i></u> restart Windows after that, to let changes to the
system register take effect in full. For more details about how to compile a program,
see <a href="compiler.htm">Compiling</a>. If you need to install in a different folder,
you can, but you have to change the path to the compiler in the "docs/install.reg" file,
where on the last line it reads:
<pre>
"" = "C:\\LINOLEUM\\MAIN\\COMPILER.EXE %1"
</pre>
...and where you'd have to place your personalized path, usually changing the "C:\\LINOLEUM"
part to whatever you extracted the ZIP file contents to. But do NOT change the structure of
the "main" directory within that path. For example, "main/lib" has to be there because it's
what the compiler looks for as the default libraries' root directory. For the same reason,
"main/sys" and "main/cpu" must be directories existing in the directory that contains the
"compiler.exe" file. The only vital part to the L.in.oleum package is indeed the "main"
folder: all the others could be deleted and the compiler would still work.
</blockquote>

<br>UNINSTALLING:<br>
<blockquote>
   Just remove the following folder:
	<blockquote>
	C:\LINOLEUM
	</blockquote>
   Well, to be sincere, I don't see any good reasons why you should
   uninstall L.in.oleum after having installed it: it takes very little space (about 4 MB),
   and it does not alter system files; it merely adds a key to the system registry, the one
   mentioned in the paragraph below, and for the rest, it's just a folder and its files;
   even if you don't use it, it won't significantly interfere with the system's activity
   and could be kept in its installation folder for future use, should you think back.
</blockquote>

<br>REMOVING THE "<u>C</u>ompile as L.in.oleum Source" option:<br>
<ol>
<li>select START&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Run</li>
<li>type "RegEdit" and press ENTER</li>
<li>you'll have to delete the following key; to do that, find the key in RegEdit's
tree, where it appears like a little folder; once you've found it, highlight it throught
a mouse click, then press the "Delete" key on your keyboard, and confirm the operation -
the key to delete is "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/TXT_SRC/shell/compile"</li>
<li>quit RegEdit, restart Windows, and that's all...</li>
</ol>
