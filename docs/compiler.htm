	SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE L.in.oleum COMPILER
	<hr size = 1 width = "100%" color = "white">
</center>

The current version of the L.in.oleum compiler is 1.13.11 beta.
The compiler is an MS-DOS application and is also able to run
on Windows 3.1, 95, 95SE, 98, NT4, ME, 2000, NT5, WindowsXP. However,
the programs produced by the compiler need <i>at least</i> Windows95.
Beta testing of compiler and applications has been successfully performed
on Windows95, 95SE, 98, ME, XP. But please note: if you have a different
version it doesn't mean the compiler or its programs won't work for you;
it simply means it's not been tested yet.

<br><br><br>
<center>
	HOW TO RUN THE L.in.oleum COMPILER
	<hr size = 1 width = "100%" color = "white">
</center>

Before attempting to compile a L.in.oleum program, you should
make sure you have extracted all the files contained in the
LINOLEUM.ZIP package to the folder C:\LINOLEUM, eventually
creating a new folder with that name in the root directory
of your C hard drive.
Compiling is extremely easy: you just have to select the
program's source code icon (a program's source code, in Lino,
is ALWAYS a very common, plain text file, having TXT extension)
using the right mouse button. Providing you have launched INSTALL.REG to
add the compiler option as described on the <a href="index.htm">intro</a> page, the pop-up
menu for all text files will show the option "<u>C</u>ompile as L.in.oleum
source code". Select the option an the compiler will do the rest... that's all.

<br><br><br>
<center>
<img src = "wg/way2.gif" width = 330 height = 116 border = 0 alt = "LAUNCHING THE COMPILER">
<br>The above picture shows what appears in the popup menu after right-clicking a text file...
</center>

<br><br><br>
<center>
<img src = "wg/way3.gif" width = 560 height = 242 border = 0 alt = "WHAT THE COMPILER SAYS">
</center>
Now, if all goes well, the compiler will start parsing the source code
and when it's done, the compiler's output window will look similar to the
above picture. Of course the most interesting informations are given
by the very last messages, claiming there were no errors, no warnings,
and no compatibility warnings. Errors, warnings and compatibility warnings
are three distinct categories of messages: if there WERE some, you would
find them listed inside a file called ERRORLOG and placed into the same
folder where the source code is.

<br><br><br>
<center>
<img src = "wg/way4.gif" width = 210 height = 70 border = 0 alt = "...AND FINALLY THE RESULTING FILES">
</center>
If, at that point, you look inside the folder where the source code was
(in the example, the folder is &quot;C:\LINOLEUM\EXAMPLES&quot;) you will
find a couple of new files, which are ALWAYS called &quot;PROGRAM&quot;
and &quot;SMBLSMAP&quot;. PROGRAM is the compiled program, and it's ready
to run. PROGRAM can be also renamed to reflect the real name of your
application; the default icon can be changed using the &quot;Icon Editor&quot;,
one of the tools included in the &quot;Examples&quot; folder of the package.
SMBLSMAP is a text file reporting a full listing of all the symbols
(constants, variables, labels) declared in the source code. You will be
understanding more of this file after you learned some L.in.oleum programming;
the symbols' map is provided by the compiler as a facility for in-depth
debugging of the applications.
If there are serious errors in the source code, the compiler does not create
those two files, and instead creates another file called ERRORLOG.

<br><br>
Note: PROGRAM can be renamed, its icon can be changed by the Icon Editor,
but MOST OF ALL, it does NEVER need any support files to run. It will run
everywhere, it will run in any folders, it doesn't need to be &quot;installed&quot;
in some crappy way. Just double-click the icon and it will run. Just move
the icon and the whole program will move along with it. THE ICON YOU SEE
<i>IS</i> THE PROGRAM, and there's nothing more than it: that ought to make
your applications rather easy to use.

<br><br>
Additional note for WindowsXP users (but also valid in general): the DOS virtual
machine where the compiler is running on WindowsXP, by default closes the black DOS
window right after the compiler terminates execution, making it impossible to read
the final status messages. To determine wether the program compiled successfully or
with serious errors, you will have to see if the ERRORLOG.TXT file has been created.
If it has been created, it means there were errors, and you should open ERRORLOG.TXT
to read about those errors and in which lines they have been found. While, if the
program compiled successfully, the ERRORLOG.TXT will be erased and the rest of
the informations about how many lines were compiled, the size of the various
components of the application, etc, can be found echoed at the end of SMBLSMAP.TXT.
